# Machine Learning Model: Multi-Class Classification
# Identification of Vegetables and Fruits

This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying data into 41 distinct categories. Below, you will find details about the project, including the dataset, training process, and how to use the model for predictions.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop a multi-class classification model using a pre-trained neural network as the base. The model is fine-tuned to accurately classify input data into one of 41 categories. The implementation leverages TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

### Key Features
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes a pre-trained model with added dense layers for multi-class classification.
- **Optimization**: Includes dropout layers to prevent overfitting and early stopping to optimize training.
- **Visualization**: Provides training and validation accuracy/loss graphs to analyze model performance.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Dataset**:
   Place your training and validation data in the `dataset/` folder. Ensure the data is properly labeled.

---

## Model Training

To train the model, execute the following steps:

1. **Load and Prepare Data**:
   Ensure your training and validation data are preprocessed and loaded correctly.

2. **Run the Training Script**:
   Open `fruitandvegetables.ipynb` or run the Python script to train the model.

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   Training and validation accuracy/loss graphs will be displayed to track the model's performance over epochs.

## Testing the Model

After training, test the model using validation data:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the trained model
model = load_model('model/model.h5')

# Test the model with new data
predictions = model.predict(test_images)
```

---

## Visualization

To visualize training and validation accuracy/loss, use the following:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example plots
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))

# Accuracy plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], 'r', label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], 'b', label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.title('Training and Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()

# Loss plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], 'r', label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], 'b', label='Validation Loss')
plt.title('Training and Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
